# Rust Programming Language

Rust is a modern, high-performance, and memory-safe programming language. It empowers developers to build efficient and reliable software, ensuring high performance without compromising on safety.

## Why Choose Rust?

Rust offers a unique combination of features that make it stand out:

- **Memory Safety:** Rust prevents segmentation faults and ensures memory safety without needing a garbage collector.
- **Performance:** Comparable to C and C++, Rust enables developers to write highly performant systems-level code.
- **Concurrency:** Built-in support for fearless concurrency with ownership and type systems.
- **Rich Ecosystem:** A growing ecosystem with tools like `Cargo` for dependency management and crates for libraries.
- **Community:** An inclusive and welcoming community that supports developers of all skill levels.

## Key Features

- **Ownership System:** Manage memory at compile-time, ensuring safe and efficient code.
- **Zero-cost Abstractions:** Write high-level abstractions without sacrificing performance.
- **Cross-platform:** Compile Rust code for multiple platforms, including Windows, macOS, Linux, and embedded systems.
- **Developer Tools:** Integrated tooling for package management (`Cargo`), formatting (`rustfmt`), and linting (`Clippy`).
- **WebAssembly:** Easily target WebAssembly for web development.

## Installation

To get started with Rust, install it using the `rustup` installer:

```bash
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
```

This command installs `rustup`, the recommended tool for managing Rust versions and associated tools.

After installation, verify the installation:

```bash
rustc --version
```

## Getting Started

1. **Create a new project:**

   ```bash
   cargo new hello_world
   cd hello_world
   ```

2. **Write your code:** Open `src/main.rs` and write your Rust code:

   ```rust
   fn main() {
       println!("Hello, world!");
   }
   ```

3. **Build and run your project:**

   ```bash
   cargo run
   ```
